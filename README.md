# 🚗 Car Price Prediction

This machine learning project predicts car prices using features like engine size, horsepower, fuel type, and more. It uses **DecisionTreeRegressor** from scikit-learn.

## 🔍 Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering (one-hot encoding, scaling)
- Model Training (Decision Tree Regressor)
- Model Evaluation (R² score, MAE, etc.)
- Predicting price for new cars

## 📊 Dataset
Used the CarPrice.csv dataset containing:
- 205 rows
- 26 columns
- Cleaned and encoded to 200+ features

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
