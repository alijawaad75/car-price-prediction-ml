# car-price-prediction-ml
This project is a complete end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting car prices based on key features of a vehicle. It demonstrates how to preprocess data, build a predictive model, and test it with new data inputs. The model is built using Python and the Decision Tree Regressor algorithm from scikit-learn.
